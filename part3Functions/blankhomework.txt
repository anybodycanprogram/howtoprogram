/**
 * Exercise 1
 * Write a function named canIRetire
 * This function should take an Int as a parameter
 * Name that parameter "myMoney"
 * If the value is above 1_000_000 (one million)
 * then print out "yes"
 * If the value is above 500_000 (five hundred thousand)
 * print out "maybe"
 * else print out "nope"
 * NOTE: NOTICE THERE IS NO RETURN TYPE HERE
 * THIS IS BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED ONE. WE JUST WANT TO
 * PRINT SOMETHING, NOT RETURN SOMETHING
 */

/**
 * Exercise 2
 * Write a function named playMatchmaker
 * This function should take THREE parameters
 * all will be of type String
 * name the first one person1 and the second
 * person2. The last parameter should be
 * named newLastName
 * The return type of this function should
 * be a String. In the body of the function, we want to:
 * return "person1 will marry person2 and their
 * new last name will be newLastName"
 * If you're confused as so how you might go about this
 * then check out "exampleFunction1" at the very top
 * or "exampleFunction2". They do the same thing in different
 * ways. You'll see what I mean. Happy Coding.
