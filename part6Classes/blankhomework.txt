It would be even better if you copied and pasted this code into intellij
and ran it that way. To see how to install intellij please go here:

If you are using IntelliJ, copy everything below this point

//"Croissant", 1.5, "LIDL
//"Coffee", 8.50, "LIDL"
//"Jam", 3.45, "LIDL"
//"Newspaper", 1.25, "Walmart"
//"Eggs", 5.25, "Walmart"

fun main() {
    // 1. Create a data class called GroceryStoreItem
    // this class should have three fields:
    // name (String), price (Double), store (String)
    // name is the name of the item, for example Croissant
    // price is the price of the item, for example 1.50
    // store is where you usually can find the item, for example LIDL

    // 2. Use the data class to instantiate several variables of type GroceryStoreItem
    // fill it with things you usually shop for. Try to add some items from the same store
    // and some items from different stores. Here's an example of one item:
    // GroceryStoreItem("croissant", 1.50, "LIDL").
    // you can find more ideas above the main method.

    // 3. Create a display method inside of the data class
    // this method should print out the following (no return type, just print)
    // "${name}'s price is ${price}. It can be found at ${store}."
    // use some of the grocery store items you've created and
    // display them on the screen.

    // 4. Create a list with all of the grocery store items in it. Save
    // this list in a variable called "groceryStoreItems".

    // 5. Create a class called GroceryStoreAnalyzer
    // add a method called "addUpAllPrices"
    // this should take as a parameter a list of grocery store items (List<GroceryStoreItem>)
    // it should return the total price of all items on your list as a Double.
    // Don't forget that before using the method, you need to instantiate
    // the class, just like with the GroceryStoreItem display method. If you're confused,
    // see the previous video for a refresher. When you're method is built and you want to
    // test it out, give it the "groceryStoreItems" variable from the previous step, step 4.

    // 6. Create another method in the GroceryStoreAnalyzer class
    // this time name it "findCheapestItem"
    // this should take as a parameter a list of grocery store items (List<GroceryStoreItem>)
    // it should return the cheapest item on your list, so the return type should be
    // GroceryStoreItem. Display this in you main function somehow, up to you!
    // When your method is built and you want to test it out, give it
    // the "groceryStoreItems" variable from step 4 as a parameter.
