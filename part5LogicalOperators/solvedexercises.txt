        //Part 2: Mango OR Strawberry?
        //Burger Empire is having a hard time getting its customers to buy
        //shakes. As an incentive to buy the more expensive mango or strawberry
        //shake flavors, Burger Empire offers its customers a free chocolate
        //chip cookie.

        //Part 3: NOT Full
        //John, our most loyal customer, has an addiction to Burger Empire and he
        //wants to start being more responsible with his food choices. You, as the
        //programmer, should prevent John from making any purchases if he is already full
        //but how do you do this? Well, welcome to the world of programming, where
        //there is typically more than one way to do the exact same thing.

        //BONUS: Add up how much John's order cost and print it to the screen!
