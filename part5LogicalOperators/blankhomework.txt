 You are really bored today and you're
 twelve years old. You want to write a program
 to tell you what to do with your day:

 If "school is out" AND "snowing" are
 the current conditions, then return
 "snowball fight".
 If just "school is out" then return
 "play videogames".
 If it is just "snowing", then return
 "look outside the window from your classroom"

 Input will be a List<String> with two conditions,
 output will be a String with activity. Assume
 that the two conditions can come in any order,
 so listOf("snowing", "") will give the same result
 as listOf("", "snowing"). HINT: use contains.
 If none of those conditions are found, return
 "do nothing".

 You want to learn a new language but you're unsure
 where you should move to. Luckily, you're a programmer
 and you've done some research and you've come up with a
 good list, but you want others to benefit from it to
 so you decided to write a program. (BTW, these are just
 examples, there are plenty of other great places to move
 to that would enable you to learn these languages):

 If you want to learn Russian or Ukrainian, then return
 "Odessa, Ukraine".

 If you want to learn Italian or German, then
 return "Tyrol (Austria/Italy)".

 If you want to learn English, then return
 "California, USA"

 If you want to learn something different, then return
 "The Internet"

 Input should be a string (a language). Output should
 be the location (also a String).

 Not all dog names are created equal. Write a function
