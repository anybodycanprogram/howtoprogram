This was previously a very long link, but I shortened it using tinyurl.com. So use that instead.

If you don't want to go to the url, here are the solutions to the exercises:

fun main() {
    //part 1, the basics
   
    //1. let's create a simple boolean variable
    //named "isItRaining", set it to "true"
    //and then print it out
    
    val isItRaining = true
    
    println(isItRaining)
    
    //2. let's create another boolean variable,
    //named isTodayChristmas
    //but this time we want it to be false
    //print it out when you are done
    
    val isItChristmas = false
    
    println(isItChristmas)
    
    //part 2, what the previous programmer left
    //we will be editing this same code block
    //the entire time
    
    val isCustomerHome = false
    
    val hasCustomerLeftInstructions = false
    
    if (isCustomerHome) {
        println("Deliver package")
    } else if (hasCustomerLeftInstructions) {
        println("Follow instructions")
    } else {
        println("Back to warehouse")
    }
    
    //1. change the value to false and re-run
    //the program
    
    //2. create a new variable, right below 
    //"isCustomerHome", named "hasCustomerLeftInstructions"
    //a. set this new variable to true
    //b. add this variable to our "decision tree"
    //c. tell the program to print "Follow instructions"
    //d. when the program enters this branch
    
    //3. set both variables to false and then re-run
    
    //4. add an else case where the branch prints out
    // "Back to warehouse"
   
    //5. Change the variables from true to false and vice-versa
    //experiment to see where the program goes
    
    //congrats!!!
